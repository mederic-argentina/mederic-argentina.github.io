# About me

I am a Professor of Physics at Université Côte d’Azur.  
My research focuses on nonlinear dynamics, hydrodynamic instabilities,  
and bio-inspired locomotion at the interface of physics, mathematics, and biology.

This site presents my [curriculum vitae](cv.html),  
details about my [research projects](research.html),  
and a full list of [publications](publications.html).
