1. **Curvature-driven transport of thin Bingham fluid layers in airway bifurcations**  
   *C. Karamaoun, H. Kumar, M. Argentina, D. Clamond, B. Mauroy*  
   **Abstract**: This study examines the mucus layer in bronchial bifurcations as a Bingham fluid. Using lubrication theory and 3D simulations, the work demonstrates that surface-tension effects at the curved air–mucus interface can displace thick mucus layers—even countering ciliary movement—to prevent mucus accumulation.

1. **Scaling the tail beat frequency and swimming speed in underwater undulatory swimming**  
   *J. Sánchez-Rodríguez, C. Raufaste, M. Argentina*  
   **Abstract**: Undulatory swimming is widespread among aquatic vertebrates. This paper proposes scaling relationships linking body length and oscillation frequency, supported by a meta-analysis across ~1200 individuals. A crossover at ~0.5–1 m alters the scaling regime.

1. **Reinforcement learning approach to control an inverted pendulum: A general framework for educational purposes**  
   *S. Israilov, L. Fu, J. Sánchez-Rodríguez, F. Fusco, G. Allibert, C. Raufaste, M. Argentina*  
   **Abstract**: Introduces a reinforcement learning framework to teach control strategies on an inverted pendulum system, highlighting its effectiveness as an educational tool for physics and engineering courses.
