1. **Curvature-driven transport of thin Bingham fluid layers in airway bifurcations**  
   *C. Karamaoun, H. Kumar, M. Argentina, D. Clamond, B. Mauroy*  
   **Abstract**:  
   We analyze mucus transport in bronchial bifurcations as a Bingham fluid.  
   Lubrication theory and 3D simulations show curvature-induced flows.  
   Surface tension effects can counteract ciliary motion.  
   This mechanism may prevent mucus accumulation.

1. **Scaling the tail beat frequency and swimming speed in underwater undulatory swimming**  
   *J. Sánchez-Rodríguez, C. Raufaste, M. Argentina*  
   **Abstract**:  
   We derive scaling laws linking body length and swimming frequency.  
   A meta-analysis on 1200 individuals validates the predictions.  
   A crossover occurs around 0.5–1 m length.  
   This unifies aquatic undulatory swimming regimes.

1. **Reinforcement learning approach to control an inverted pendulum**  
   *S. Israilov, L. Fu, J. Sánchez-Rodríguez, F. Fusco, G. Allibert, C. Raufaste, M. Argentina*  
   **Abstract**:  
   We present a reinforcement learning framework for inverted pendulum control.  
   It enables students to experiment with nonlinear dynamics.  
   The approach outperforms classical controllers.  
   Provides a flexible and educational testbed.
