    <b>Abstract:</b> (The mucus on the bronchial wall forms a thin layer of non-Newtonian fluid, protecting the lungs by capturing inhaled pollutants. Due to the corrugation of its interface with air, this layer is subject to surface tension forces that affect its rheology. This physical system is analyzed using lubrication theory and three-dimensional simulations. We characterize the nonlinear behavior of the mucus and show that surface tension effects can displace overly thick mucus layers in airway bifurcations. This movement can disrupt the mucociliary clearance and break the homogeneity of the layer thickness.)

    <b>Title:</b> Scaling the tail beat frequency and swimming speed in underwater undulatory swimming<br/>

    <b>Abstract:</b> (Undulatory swimming is the predominant form of locomotion in aquatic vertebrates. A myriad of animals of different species and sizes oscillate their bodies to propel themselves in aquatic environments with swimming speed scaling as the product of the animal length by the oscillation frequency. Although frequency tuning is the primary means by which a swimmer selects its speed, there is no consensus on the mechanisms involved. In this article, we propose scaling laws for undulatory swimmers that relate oscillation frequency to length by taking into account both the biological characteristics of the muscles and the interaction of the moving swimmer with its environment. Results are supported by an extensive literature review including approximately 1200 individuals of different species, sizes and swimming environments. We highlight a crossover in size around 0.5–1 m. Below this value, the frequency can be tuned between 2–20 Hz due to biological constraints and the interplay between slow and fast muscles. Above this value, the fluid-swimmer interaction must be taken into account and the frequency is inversely proportional to the length of the animal. This approach predicts a maximum swimming speed around 5–10 m.s−1 for large swimmers, consistent with the threshold to prevent bubble cavitation.)

    <b>Title:</b> Reinforcement learning approach to control an inverted pendulum: A general framework for educational purposes<br/>

    <b>Abstract:</b> (Machine learning is often cited as a new paradigm in control theory, but is also often viewed as empirical and less intuitive for students than classical model-based methods. This is particularly the case for reinforcement learning, an approach that does not require any mathematical model to drive a system inside an unknown environment. This lack of intuition can be an obstacle to design experiments and implement this approach. Reversely there is a need to gain experience and intuition from experiments. In this article, we propose a general framework to reproduce successful experiments and simulations based on the inverted pendulum, a classic problem often used as a benchmark to evaluate control strategies. Two algorithms (basic Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN)) are introduced, both in experiments and in simulation with a virtual environment, to give a comprehensive understanding of the approach and discuss its implementation on real systems. In experiments, we show that learning over a few hours is enough to control the pendulum with high accuracy. Simulations provide insights about the effect of each physical parameter and tests the feasibility and robustness of the approach.)

    <b>Title:</b> Three-dimensional liquid foam flow through a hopper resolved by fast X-ray microtomography<br/>

    <b>Abstract:</b> We probe the complex rheological behaviour of liquid foams flowing through a conical constriction. With fast X-ray tomographic microscopy we measure in situ the displacement and deformation of up to fifty thousand bubbles at any single time instance while varying systematically the foam liquid fraction, the bubble size and the flow direction – convergent vs. divergent. The large statistics and high spatio-temporal resolution allows to observe and quantify the deviations from a purely viscous flow. We indeed reveal an asymmetry between the convergent and divergent flows associated to the emergence of elastic stresses in the latter case, and enhanced as the liquid fraction is reduced. Such effect is related to the reorientation of the deformed bubbles flowing out of the constriction, from a prolate to an oblate shape in average, while they pass through the hopper waist.

    <b>Title:</b> Redistribution of translational kinetic energy: the surprises of bounces<br/>

    <b>Abstract:</b> The topic of collisions is introduced in university education to address the laws of conservation of momentum and energy. In particular, students are asked to classify collisions as either elastic or inelastic. They are often left with the idea that ‘macroscopic energy’ has been transformed into ‘microscopic energy’ in the case of an inelastic collision, but their understanding of the processes of redistribution of kinetic energy to other degrees of freedom, often called ‘dissipation’, is mostly very poor. The aim of this article is to see how to facilitate the understanding of these processes among university students. Firstly, the results of a questionnaire with 27 university students show that they consider mass and material as the most important determinants of the coefficient of restitution of the bounce of a ball on a solid and rigid support, while the notion of internal structure, which is however essential, is not considered. Second, a simple model contextualizes the idea of a temporal sequence of successive events in the rebound of inhomogeneous projectiles. Finally, recent results on bilayered projectiles are exploited to emphasize the non-trivial influence of the structure of a body on the restitution of its initial translational kinetic energy after rebound on a support. These different elements contribute to conceive possible teaching objectives, to propose simple experiments and to address the conditions for progress in this field

    <b>Title:</b> Intracellular pH is a vital parameter that is maintained close to neutrality in all mammalian cells and tissues and acidic in most intracellular compartments. After presenting the main techniques used for intracellular an vesicular pH measurements we will briefly recall the main molecular mechanisms that affect and regulate intracellular pH. Following this we will discuss the large functional redundancy found in the transporters of H+ or acid-base equivalents. For this purpose, we will use mathematical modeling to simulate cellular response to persistent and/or transient acidification, in the presence of different transporters, single or in combination. We will also test the presence or absence of intracellular buffering. This latter section will highlight how modeling can yield fundamental insight into deep biological questions such as the utility of functional redundancy in natural selection.<br/>
