# Research

My research focuses on **fluid mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, and biomimetic swimming**.  

Key topics:  
- Hydrodynamics of undulatory swimming  
- Collective motion of swimmers  
- Proprioceptive mechanisms in locomotion  
- Development of biomimetic robotic swimmers  
- Machine learning approaches for optimal locomotion strategies
