    <b>Abstract:</b><br/>
    The mucus on the bronchial wall forms a thin layer of non-Newtonian fluid, protecting the lungs by capturing inhaled pollutants. Due to the corrugation of its interface with air, this layer is subject to surface tension forces that affect its rheology. This physical system is analyzed using lubrication theory and three-dimensional simulations. We characterize the nonlinear behavior of the mucus and show that surface tension effects can displace overly thick mucus layers in airway bifurcations. This movement can disrupt mucociliary clearance and break the homogeneity of the layer thickness.

    <b>Title:</b> Scaling the tail beat frequency and swimming speed in underwater undulatory swimming<br/>
    <b>Authors:</b> J. Sánchez-Rodríguez, C. Raufaste, M. Argentina<br/>
    <b>Reference:</b> Nature Communications, 14, 5569 (2023)<br/>

    <b>Abstract:</b><br/>
    Undulatory swimming is the predominant form of locomotion among aquatic vertebrates. A myriad of animals of different species and sizes oscillate their bodies to propel themselves in aquatic environments with swimming speed scaling as the product of the animal length by the oscillation frequency. Although frequency tuning is the primary means by which a swimmer selects its speed, there is no consensus on the mechanisms involved. In this article, we propose scaling laws for undulatory swimmers that relate oscillation frequency to length by taking into account both the biological characteristics of the muscles and the interaction of the moving swimmer with its environment. Results are supported by an extensive literature review including approximately 1200 individuals of different species, sizes and swimming environments. We highlight a crossover in length around 0.5-1 m. Below this value, the frequency can be tuned between 2–20 Hz due to biological constraints and the interplay between slow and fast muscles. Above this value, the fluid-swimmer interaction must be taken into account and the frequency is inversely proportional to the length of the animal. This approach predicts a maximum swimming speed around 5–10 m/s for large swimmers, consistent with the threshold to prevent bubble cavitation.

    <b>Abstract:</b><br/>
    Intracellular pH is a vital parameter that is maintained close to neutrality in all mammalian cells and tissues and acidic in most intracellular compartments. After presenting the main techniques used for intracellular and vesicular pH measurements we briefly recall the main molecular mechanisms that affect and regulate intracellular pH. Following this we discuss the large functional redundancy found in the transporters of H⁺ or acid–base equivalents. For this purpose, we use mathematical modeling to simulate the cellular response to persistent and/or transient acidification, in the presence of different transporters, single or in combination.
